# This is a comment
print("Hello World")


#A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:
# print("Hello World")




#Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments. To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:

#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line

print("Hello, World!")
